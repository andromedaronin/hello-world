stepping into a new start
hi, my name is joshua and i am beginning taking my first steps into starting a career in tech. i want to enter into data analysis or start my own studio and publish small indie titles. i am nervous to start and begin publishing or just presenting my work to the world. it is an exciting start and i hope to just create something fun.
